# UFOs
## Overview of the Analysis
While having data is great, sharing data is better! For this reason, we wanted to create a website that will host our data in table while providing a nice narrative. To top it off, the data table on our webpage is searchable! Users can filter the dataset by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape. This provides anyone with the ability to select the data that they are interested in.

## Results
Searching the data table on the website is easy! Simply enter the information you wish to filter the dataset by and hit enter! The table will display only the UFO incidents that match your selection.

Examples:

* Here is what the data table looks like when no search criteria are entered:

* If would like to search by the name of a city, simply enter the city name in the search box and press enter:

* You can also search by multiple items at the same time. Here we searched by the city named "El Cajon" and by a date of "1/4/2010":
